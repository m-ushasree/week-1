#  Carbon Emission Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast per capita CO₂ emissions based on historical and country-specific indicators such as GDP, energy use, and population metrics. Built using Random Forest Regression, the model provides reliable emission forecasts and offers insights that can support data-driven climate policy decisions.

##  Project Workflow

###  1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and transformed data from World Bank Climate Change Data.
- Removed nulls, transformed columns, normalized formats.

###  2. Data Exploration
- Analyzed feature relationships using:
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Scatter plots
  - Outlier analysis
- Focused on energy use, GDP, urbanization.

###  3. Model Building
- Selected top features using RFECV.
- Trained a Random Forest Regressor.
- Tuned with GridSearchCV & validated using 10-fold CV.
- Forecasted emissions for next 20 years using CAGR method.
